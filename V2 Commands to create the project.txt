In this commit "https://github.com/SuyashJoshi/chai-aur-react/tree/859a0f6e9d9bfe0193ef3e2f490734555b4f3df4", I have done below activities:

Create basic React Project using NPX (Project name: 01basicreact)
-> npx create-react-app 01basicreact

In the above command:
1. npx -> It is an executer (Node Package Executer)
2. create-react-app -> It is a utility (a software) to create react app.
3. 01basicreact -> It is the project name.

Run the above project
-> One we are in the folder of the project where we are having the package.json we will run
-> npm run start

Create a vite project "01vitereact"
-> npm create vite@latest

Note: we will have to run this command as it is and once we run this command, Vite bundler will ask us to:- 
1. Ok To proceed? (y) - Enter y.
1. Provide the project name. - I am giving Project name as "01vitereact"
2. Select the framework from "Vanilla", "Vue", "React", "Preact", "Lit", "Svelte", "Solid", "Qwik", "Others". (We will select "React")
3. Once we select React, we will get options to select a variant from the list showing "TypeScript", "Typescript + SWC", "Javascript", "Javascript + SWC". (We will select Javascript)

-> Once you are in the project folder run the below command.
